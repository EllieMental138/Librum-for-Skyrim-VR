# Getting Started in Librum
This guide will help you get off the ground in Librum -- Librum changes a great deal about Skyrim's world, inhabitants, and mechanics, and you'll need to familiarize yourself with the new rules of the road. If you have not done so yet, read the [Readme](README.md) to install Librum and learn a little about it.

# Character Creation
## Appearance and Race
If you boot up Librum and create a new game, you'll find yourself in the new character creation area -- the [Realm of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18223) -- looking at the glitchy [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) menu. Before finalizing your race and appearance, here are the details you need to know:

Race abilities are given by EnaiSiaion's popular [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315) mod, with two modifications. Argonians are 50% resistant to _water damage_, and Orcs are 50% resistant to _earth damage_. These are new damage types introduced by [Elemental Destruction Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/440), and you will encounter enemy mages who make use of them. For detailed information on racial abilities, see the [Imperious mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315).

 Race | Health | Magicka | Stamina | H/M/S Regen | Carry Weight | Resistances | Abilities
 ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------
 Altmer | 90   | 115     | 95      | 0.5%, 3.75%, 4.5% | 250    | 

Next, you'll notice that the character appearance menu is a little janky. Unfortunately, that's the state of the art in Skyrim VR; to fine-tune settings, you need to make use of the new cursor. In particular, Librum comes with a few hundred graphical _overlays_ for your character: tattoos, scars, freckles, and more. These can be found in the _Makeup_ and _Paint_ tabs, at the far right of the menu. To apply a new overlay, click "Choose Texture" at the bottom of the menu, navigate to the one you want (using the cursor to scroll), and select it. Then, click "Choose Color" and repeat.

## The Realm of Lorkhan 
Once you finish selecting your race, gender, and appearance, you will be put into the [Realm of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18223) before venturing out into Skyrim. At this point, remember to set your MCM settings according to the [Readme](README.md#configure-the-mcm).

In the Realm, you can choose from plenty of equipment, spells, perks, factions, and starting locations. I will go over many of these in the section that follows. Importantly, note two major differences between Librum and the vanilla Realm of Lorkhan mod:
 - Once you leave the Realm, you cannot re-enter. For this reason, I recommend you make a save before exiting to Skyrim.
 - You can only choose a Standing Stone blessing from within the Realm of Lorkhan. Standing Stones still exist around Skyrim, but they are only aesthetic.
