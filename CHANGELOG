***Note:*** Librum versions are of the form _x.y-z_. In this notation, changes
to the _x_ or _y_ denote significant updates, and you will need to read the
update notes to see how to patch your savefile. Changes to the _z_ denote
small bugfixes, and will never require a patched save.

***v0.6.***

 vanilla slow time effects, and drains stamina.
