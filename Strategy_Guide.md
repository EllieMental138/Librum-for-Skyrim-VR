# Getting Started in Librum
This guide will help you get off the ground in Librum -- Librum changes a great deal about Skyrim's world, inhabitants, and mechanics, and you'll need to familiarize yourself with the new rules of the road. If you have not done so yet, read the [Readme](README.md) to install Librum and learn a little about it.

# Character Creation
## Appearance and Race
If you boot up Librum and create a new game, you'll find yourself in the new character creation area -- the [Nightmare of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46649) -- looking at the [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) menu. Before finalizing your race and appearance, here are the details you need to know:

***Race Abilites.*** Race abilities are given by [Legacy - A Race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415), with two modifications. Argonians are 50% resistant to _water damage_, and Orcs are 50% resistant to _earth damage_. These are new damage types introduced by [Elemental Destruction Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/440), and you will encounter enemy mages who make use of them. For detailed information on racial abilities, see the [Legacy mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415); notably, once-a-day powers have been supplemented with interesting passive abilities that enemies will have too.

There are a few non-ability-related differences between the various races. Importantly, _beast races cannot wear shoes_. In addition to locking them out of certain enchantments (e.g., muffle), this gives both Khajiits and Argonians a higher susceptibility to frostbite. You'll need to find alternate solutions, like magical spells or avoiding Skyrim's northern reaches, in order to avoid the cold.

Furthermore, some races start with spells. Although this doesn't make a huge difference in vanilla Skyrim, you'll find that beginning your Spell Research journey is otherwise very difficult. Namely:
 1. Altmer (High Elves) begin with _Fury_.
 2. Bretons begin with _Conjure Familiar_.
 3. Dunmer (Dark Elves) begin with _Sparks_. 

***Appearance.*** Next, you'll notice that the character appearance menu is a little janky for those of you playing VR. Unfortunately, that's the state of the art in Skyrim VR; to fine-tune settings, you need to make use of the new cursor. In particular, Librum comes with a few hundred graphical _overlays_ for your character: tattoos, scars, freckles, and more. These can be found in the _Makeup_ and _Paint_ tabs, at the far right of the menu. To apply a new overlay, click "Choose Texture" at the bottom of the menu, navigate to the one you want (using the cursor to scroll), and select it. Then, click "Choose Color" and repeat.

## The Nightmare of Lorkhan 
Once you finish selecting your race, gender, and appearance, you will be put into the [Nightmare of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46649) before venturing out into Skyrim. At this point, remember to set your MCM settings according to the [Readme](README.md#configure-the-mcm).

![Alt Text](Resources/nightmare.png?raw=true "The Nightmare of Lorkhan")

Here are a few things to note about the Nightmare of Lorkhan:
 - You will need the torches on the table beside you to navigate the Realm.
 - Be careful as there are a few bear traps placed around. Watch the ground.
 - Please check the entirity of the Realm, there's a few armour & weapon sets placed around for you, as well as some gold, a pickaxe and a woodcutter's axe.
 - Once you leave the Realm, you cannot re-enter. For this reason, I recommend you make a save before exiting to Skyrim.
 - You can only choose a Standing Stone blessing from within the Nightmare of Lorkhan. Standing Stones still exist around Skyrim, but they are only aesthetic.

***Standing Stones.*** Every Standing Stone can be found within the Nightmare of Lorkhan, and -- as mentioned -- you can only choose a Standing Stone blessing while you are within the Realm. These blessings are governed by [Curse of the Firmament](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28419), and I recommend you look at that mod page for more information. Notably, each stone has both a blessing and a curse, and the modpage gives you recommended builds for each, as well as a difficulty rating.

***Wintersun Faiths.*** Shrines to the Nine Divines are also in the Nightmare. You can use these to choose a deity for your character to worship, thereby receiving bonuses and abilities if you increase your favor with them. Each deity is listed at [Wintersun Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506), but you'll have to discover any other shrines in Skyrim to worship other deities.

***Daggerfall Traits.*** To help assist you in your builds, we have [Daggerfall Traits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29416), bringing the classic traits from Daggerfall into Skyrim via a point-buy system. For each Benefit you take, you spend points. To get more points, you must give yourself a Detriment. You can have 5 traits total. Once you have chosen your traits, you are asked to confirm them. Once you confirm, you _cannot change them again_, please make sure you are 100% on your choice before confirming.

_Benefits_:
 - Adrenaline Rush - Gain a bonus to your attack damage and damage resistance while low on health.
 - Athletecism - +100 stamina.
 - Bonus against - Gain bonus damage against animals, humanoids, daedra, or the undead.
 - Expertise - Cause more damage with this weapon type.
 - Immunity - Gain total immunity to this element.
 - Rapid Healing - The rate at which you regenerate health is increased greatly.
 - Resist - Gain 50% resistance to this element.
 - Spell Absorb - Able to absorb hostile spells when not at full magicka, spells that fail to absorb cause massive damage.
 - Wisdom - Gain +50, +100, or +200 magicka.

_Detriments_:
 - Damage - Receive damage when in strong light or when inside temples and inside halls of the dead.
 - Dark Magic - Magical ability reduced or nullified entirely when not in darkness.
 - Forbidden - You cannot cause damage with this weapon type.
 - Light Magic - Magical ability reduced or nullified entirely when not in light.
 - Low Tolerance - Gain 50% weakness to this element.
 - Phobia - Cause reduced damage to and receive extra damage from animals, humanoids, daedra, or the undead.
 - Stunted Magicka - Cannot regenerate spell points normally
 - Weakness - Gain 100% weakness to this element.
 - Forbidden Material - Weapons and armor made of this material are useless when worn by you.

***Starting Locations.*** Once you've chosen your traits, your standing stone and found your equipment, you have to choose where to start out in Skyrim. As mentioned before, you _cannot re-enter the Realm_ once you leave, so choose carefully.

Since the fast travel network is much denser in Librum's Skyrim -- with several new carriages and boats to bring you from place to place, thanks to [CFTO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) -- it largely does not matter if you start in one city or another. However, you'll want to be careful if you start in the wilderness or (even more dangerously) in a dungeon. Dungeons are now at fixed levels (labeled when you point your hand at the corresponding teleportation crystal), so make sure you choose a low-level one or feel particularly confident. Similarly, different wilderness zones offer different challenges, as catalogued in the [Creatures and Encounter Zones](#creatures-and-encounter-zones) section later on. Do note that the vanilla start is completely disabled, so starting at Helgen or the border will not start the main quest automatically.

***Everything past this point is WIP***
# Surviving the Night
## Making Money
Money is a rare commodity in Librum, and there are several new mechanics to familiarize yourself with before we start:
 - Money weighs you down. Each coin weighs 0.01 unit, so you won't be able to save up too much of it. This couples poorly with the new carry weight penalties catalogued in the next section.
 - You have to pay your followers to maintain their services. They need 500 Septims per week. This does not apply to certain mod-added followers like Lucien who are not incorporated into the follower framework.
 - Barter prices depend greatly on you, your reputation, and the person you're trading with. Buying directly from producers and craftsmen will save you money, while trading with fences or general goods merchants will cost you. Merchants in bigger cities will have more gold to trade with. Prices will depend on your race, your faction memberships, your relationship with the merchant, as well as how covered in blood and dirt you are. Rain and swimming will clean you up a little, but you can also use the _Wash and Rinse_ ability to clean yourself fully.
 - Loot is generally much rarer. It won't be uncommon for you to unlock a chest and find nothing inside.
 - Many more things are considered crimes, and you'll be fined appropriately. This includes waiting in cities ("vagrancy"), using crafting apparatuses without permission, using loud crafting apparatuses at night ("disturbing the peace"), hunting without a license, looting friendly corpses, and sitting in the Jarl's throne. If you want to make money, be sure to follow the rules.

![Alt Text](Resources/coins.png?raw=true "Rally's Five Cities Currencies. Coin textures depend on your location.")

With that out of the way, there are a few good strategies to get money early on. 
 - There is a follower in Falkreath who actually pays you to tag along
 - Since dungeon diving can be much more dangerous, don't ignore the smaller quests just helping people around towns. These can give you a few hundred Septims for simple tasks. Every hold has some of these, so this can add up quickly. Check the notice boards and look for easy ones!
 - Alchemy and Smithing can make some money, but it's going to be _much_ more difficult. Since your early creations will probably sell for a mere handful of Septims, you might even come out at a loss after renting a workstation to make them. Enchanting is not actually even available until you take at least one perk in it.
 - Chopping wood and picking crops can net you some cash, but it's a pretty low rate of return for the work, so make sure you're selling it to someone who will buy for at least one or two Septims. That is, unless you're in VR, where chopping wood is broken, so... avoid that.
 - While armor and weapons don't have a great value/weight ratio, the dead won't miss it. Remember, though: looting friendlies is a crime.
 - On the topic of crime, steal it! Just remember that if you're stealing goods, people generally get upset, and you'll need a fence...
 - also if you come up with any, feel free to share because we're also poor

## Carry Weight Penalties

Your carry weight now becomes a factor before you hit the vanilla limit for over-encumbered. This is controlled by [Cobb Encumbrance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18362), and the specific settings can be found in the MCM. In short, the heavier your pack, the slower you move, starting when you are carrying half of your maximum. The movement speed penalty increases as more weight is added, until ultimately the weight of your pack will start to crush you to death. On the flip side, being below one fourth of your max weight will give you a slight speed bonus. Notifications will let you know as you pass through stages of encumbrance. Since being crushed to death is generally undesirable and being slow can get you killed, you'll probably want to keep your pack light and your maximum carry weight high.
 - Just like vanilla Skyrim, having a home base is always a great way to hang on to all that iron ore.
 - Followers can carry a lot as well. NFF provides additional follower inventory separate from where you should give them equipment to use.
 - Some vendors have backpacks you can purchase to increase your total carry weight. Backpacks can also be crafted.
 - Enchanted items to increase carry weight are not only more rare, but also unusable until you put a perk or two into enchanting. Don't count on these in the early game.

## Food, Water, and Fatigue

Through [Sunhelm Survival and Needs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414), your character now needs food, water, and sleep to survive. In addition, diseases are more dangerous. For longer sojourns into the wilds of Tamriel, you will want to pack adequate supplies. Getting too hungry, thirsty, or tired will incrementally debuff your health, stamina, and magicka, as well as their regeneration rates. Go too long without tending to your needs can lead to your death.
 - Food can be gathered in all the usual ways: buying it, cooking it yourself, or just pulling it out of the ground. Stealing, too, if you're the type. [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900) also makes hunting an excellent source of food. Be warned, however, that like crafting stations, you have to pay a fee to whomever owns the cooking station you're trying to use if it's owned. Furthermore, eating raw meat can be deleterious to the health of most races. Luckily, the camping mechanics allow you some basic cooking.
 - For the truly desperate or those so inclined, fresh humanoid bodies can be cannibalised. Just don't let anyone catch you.
 - Water abounds in Skyrim, and you can use the _Drink and Fill_ power to drink directly from clean water sources as well as fill any waterskins you are carrying. You can also find other items to slake your thirst, so keep your eyes open, and when necessary, salt water can be boiled at a campfire to make fresh water. Soup helps for hunger and thirst.
 - Werewolves recover both hunger and thirst when feeding, but changing back increases fatigue. Vampires get thirst back from drinking blood, too.
 - Diseases now progress through worsening stages, and several more have been added. Shrines will no longer cure you, either. Wise adventurers will buy or craft potions of cure disease, but healers may be able to cure you for a small fee.
 - Sleeping recovers fatigue (in addition to being necessary to level up), but you have to be careful where you sleep! You can craft or purchase bedrolls to sleep anywhere, but most places will leave you vulnerable to attack. If you must sleep in the wild, be sure to set up traps for protection. Sleeping at inns is a much better option, despite the small fee. Joining a faction, like the Companions, is also a great option for early game. No place is 100% safe from attack, though.

## Weather and Camping
[Frostfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/671) makes the cold weather of Skyrim something to be truly feared, but it also gives you the tools to survive. The details are too much for this guide, but the [website](http://skyrimsurvival.com/home/frostfall/how-to-play/) is thorough. Pay attention to the plethora of powers added by this mod, as knowing how and when to use them can save your life. Some tips:
 - Be careful in snowy places! Bad weather can increase your exposure _very_ quickly, including reducing your movement speed, making it even harder to find shelter. Swimming or otherwise letting your gear get wet just makes it worse. Dying is very easy. Come prepared.
 - Campfires need wood, which can be gathered in wooded areas.
 - At a campfire, you have lots of options for your survival needs, including a whole set of skill trees as you get better at enduring the harsh environments you will face in your travels. Don't ignore them!
 - You can and should also bring a tent with you any time you might face being stranded in some frozen wasteland. This isn't quite as bad in the low-level areas, thankfully.


# New Gameplay Mechanics
## Leveling and Progression
In regards to character progression, Librum primarily takes inspiration from the Soulsborn and Dragon Age series of games. The core point here is, the type of adventure you go on changes as you become more and more powerful -- while you may just be hunting wildlife and running errands at low levels, you progress to the point where you can go into certain dungeons and abandoned forts, and next to the point where you can handle more fantastical opponents: for instance, automata, undead, or otherworldly beings. After that point, the player starts doing really crazy stuff: going to planes of Oblivion, traveling outside of Skyrim, and truly saving the world.
 - Good gear is vital, but will only take you so far, especially at first. 
 - You likely won't get any perk points for a while, and that's okay.
 - Don't forget that you have to sleep a full eight hours to level up. Even without perk points, the extra health/stamina/magicka is important.
 - Your skills will still increase, albeit more slowly, and scale higher. 
 - Dungeons and the like show their level, but they're more like guidelines for what it takes to clear the whole area. For example, ith a good party and good tactics (and a whole lot of luck), a level 5 character still can clear a level 8 - 20 dungeon. 

## Spell Research
Librum is inherently a low-magic setting, so there is a lot working against you as a mage. However, if you _can_ discover the secrets of controlling magic, there is much more power available to you than in vanilla Skyrim. Many of the new spell "schools" or "archetypes" are described in the [Readme](README.md), so we focus here on how to start out.

First things first, you need to acquire your first spell. Most races do not start out with any spells (see the section on [character creation](#the-nightmare-of-lorkhan), so if you're not an Altmer, Dunmer, or Breton, you will need to acquire a spell elsewhere. Here are some important points on this front:
 - Spell tomes are exceedingly rare. Merchants do not sell them, they cannot be found in containers or on creatures, and only a few hand-placed ones exist in various dungeons.
 - You cannot read spell tomes above your skill level. For instance, if your Destruction skill is lower than 25, you cannot use an Apprentice tome.
 - The easiest way to acquire a spell is to enter the College of Winterhold. Faralda will still grant you one at the gate, and you now get to choose which school it's from. See [Better College Application](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5272) for more details.
 - You _can_ research your own spell without having one to begin with. Continue reading for more info on research.

![Alt Text](Resources/research.png?raw=true "Spell Research")

Prioritise getting a research journal, alembic and tongs.  
 - Go to college of Winterhold to get your first spell, unless you are a race that starts with one. Researching the spell will give you basic experience with some archetypes.  
 - If you find any strange items like "enchanted axe-head" analyze this to get LOTS of experience.   
 - Use the alembic to dissolve individual reagents you find, then analyze the resulting solution - this will grant experience and unlock new archetypes.  
 - Loot any rolls of paper, charcoal, inkwells or quills that you come across.   
 - In particular, find the solution that is used to make paper and ink! Select "mix solutions" and look what inputs are needed.  
 - Rest to get rid of mental exhaustion, note that longer rests have exponentially more effect - 8 hours+.   
 - Hold on to weakness/aversion poisons as these are used to fuel the cauldron. You can dissolve bulk quantities of reagents and get huge amounts of solutions.  
 - When analyzing solutions the xp gain is exponential - try to analyze them in batches of 100+.   
 - Prioritize getting reagents to make cauldron fuel  
 - Once you have unlock various archetypes you can compose theses.   
 - You can combine theses to try unlocking a spell, for novice rank only 20 xp in each archetype is enough. 1000 for apprentice!   
 - Duplicates can be used to boost the success chance - especially important when you are missing certain archetypes.  
 - When you have LOTS of experience you can throw in a single thesis and still get success.
