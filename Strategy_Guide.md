# Getting Started in Librum
This guide will help you get off the ground in Librum -- Librum changes a great deal about Skyrim's world, inhabitants, and mechanics, and you'll need to familiarize yourself with the new rules of the road. If you have not done so yet, read the [Readme](README.md) to install Librum and learn a little about it.

# Character Creation
## Appearance and Race
If you boot up Librum and create a new game, you'll find yourself in the new character creation area -- the [Nightmare of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46649) -- looking at the [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) menu. Before finalizing your race and appearance, here are the details you need to know:

***Race Abilites.*** Race abilities are given by [Legacy - A Race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415), with two modifications. Argonians are 50% resistant to _water damage_, and Orcs are 50% resistant to _earth damage_. These are new damage types introduced by [Elemental Destruction Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/440), and you will encounter enemy mages who make use of them. For detailed information on racial abilities, see the [Legacy mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36415); notably, once-a-day powers have been replaced with interesting passive abilities that enemies will have too.

There are a few non-ability-related differences between the various races. Importantly, _beast races cannot wear shoes_. In addition to locking them out of certain enchantments (e.g., muffle), this gives both Khajiits and Argonians a higher susceptibility to frostbite. You'll need to find alternate solutions, like magical spells or avoiding Skyrim's northern reaches, in order to avoid the cold.

Furthermore, some races start with spells. Although this doesn't make a huge difference in vanilla Skyrim, you'll find that beginning your Spell Research journey is otherwise very difficult. Namely:
 1. Altmer (High Elves) begin with _Fury_.
 2. Bretons begin with _Conjure Familiar_.
 3. Dunmer (Dark Elves) begin with _Sparks_. 

***Appearance.*** Next, you'll notice that the character appearance menu is a little janky for those of you playing VR. Unfortunately, that's the state of the art in Skyrim VR; to fine-tune settings, you need to make use of the new cursor. In particular, Librum comes with a few hundred graphical _overlays_ for your character: tattoos, scars, freckles, and more. These can be found in the _Makeup_ and _Paint_ tabs, at the far right of the menu. To apply a new overlay, click "Choose Texture" at the bottom of the menu, navigate to the one you want (using the cursor to scroll), and select it. Then, click "Choose Color" and repeat.

## The Nightmare of Lorkhan 
Once you finish selecting your race, gender, and appearance, you will be put into the [Nightmare of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46649) before venturing out into Skyrim. At this point, remember to set your MCM settings according to the [Readme](README.md#configure-the-mcm).

![Alt Text](Resources/nightmare.png?raw=true "The Nightmare of Lorkhan")

Here are a few things to note about the Nightmare of Lorkhan:
 - You will need the torches on the table beside you to navigate the Realm.
 - Be careful as there are a few bear traps placed around. Watch the ground.
 - Please check the entirity of the Realm, there's a few armour & weapon sets placed around for you, as well as some gold, a pickaxe and a woodcutter's axe.
 - Once you leave the Realm, you cannot re-enter. For this reason, I recommend you make a save before exiting to Skyrim.
 - You can only choose a Standing Stone blessing from within the Nightmare of Lorkhan. Standing Stones still exist around Skyrim, but they are only aesthetic.

***Standing Stones.*** Every Standing Stone can be found within the Nightmare of Lorkhan, and -- as mentioned -- you can only choose a Standing Stone blessing while you are within the Realm. These blessings are governed by [Curse of the Firmament](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28419), and I recommend you look at that mod page for more information. Notably, each stone has both a blessing and a curse, and the modpage gives you recommended builds for each, as well as a difficulty rating.

***Daggerfall Traits.*** To help assist you in your builds, we have [Daggerfall Traits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29416), bringing the classic traits from Daggerfall into Skyrim via a point-buy system. For each Benefit you take, you spend points. To get more points, you must give yourself a Detriment. You can have 5 traits total. Once you have chosen your traits, you are asked to confirm them. Once you confirm, you _cannot change them again_, please make sure you are 100% on your choice before confirming.

_Benefits_:
 - Adrenaline Rush - Gain a bonus to your attack damage and damage resistance while low on health.
 - Athletecism - +100 stamina.
 - Bonus against - Gain bonus damage against animals, humanoids, daedra, or the undead.
 - Expertise - Cause more damage with this weapon type.
 - Immunity - Gain total immunity to this element.
 - Rapid Healing - The rate at which you regenerate health is increased greatly.
 - Resist - Gain 50% resistance to this element.
 - Spell Absorb - Able to absorb hostile spells when not at full magicka, spells that fail to absorb cause massive damage.
 - Wisdom - Gain +50, +100, or +200 magicka.

_Detriments_:
 - Damage - Receive damage when in strong light or when inside temples and inside halls of the dead.
 - Dark Magic - Magical ability reduced or nullified entirely when not in darkness.
 - Forbidden - You cannot cause damage with this weapon type.
 - Light Magic - Magical ability reduced or nullified entirely when not in light.
 - Low Tolerance - Gain 50% weakness to this element.
 - Phobia - Cause reduced damage to and receive extra damage from animals, humanoids, daedra, or the undead.
 - Stunted Magicka - Cannot regenerate spell points normally
 - Weakness - Gain 100% weakness to this element.
 - Forbidden Material - Weapons and armor made of this material are useless when worn by you.

***Starting Locations.*** Once you've chosen your traits, your standing stone and found your equipment, you have to choose where to start out in Skyrim. As mentioned before, you _cannot re-enter the Realm_ once you leave, so choose carefully.

Since the fast travel network is much denser in Librum's Skyrim -- with several new carriages and boats to bring you from place to place, thanks to [CFTO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) -- it largely does not matter if you start in one city or another. However, you'll want to be careful if you start in the wilderness or (even more dangerously) in a dungeon. Dungeons are now at fixed levels (labeled when you point your hand at the corresponding teleportation crystal), so make sure you choose a low-level one or feel particularly confident. Similarly, different wilderness zones offer different challenges, as catalogued in the [Creatures and Encounter Zones](#creatures-and-encounter-zones) section later on.

## Making Money
Money is a rare commodity in Librum, and there are several new mechanics to familiarize yourself with before we start:
 - Money weighs you down. Each coin weighs 0.01 unit, so you won't be able to save up too much of it. This couples poorly with the new carry weight penalties catalogued in the next section.
 - You have to pay your followers to maintain their services. They need 500 Septims per week.
 - Barter prices depend greatly on you, your reputation, and the person you're trading with. Buying directly from producers and craftsmen will save you money, while trading with fences or general goods merchants will cost you. Merchants in bigger cities will have more gold to trade with. Prices will depend on your race, your faction memberships, and your relationship with the merchant.
 - Loot is generally much rarer. It won't be uncommon for you to unlock a chest and find nothing inside.
 - Many more things are considered crimes, and you'll be fined appropriately. This includes waiting in cities ("vagrancy"), using crafting apparatuses without permission, using loud crafting apparatuses at night ("disturbing the peace"), hunting without a license, looting friendly corpses, and sitting in the Jarl's throne. If you want to make money, be sure to follow the rules.

With that out of the way, there are a few good strategies to get money early on.

# New Gameplay Mechanics
## Leveling and Progression
In regards to character progression, Librum primarily takes inspiration from the  The core point here is, the type of adventure you go on changes as you become more and more powerful -- while you may just be hunting wildlife at low levels, you progress to the point where you can go into certain dungeons and abandoned forts, and next to the point where you can handle more fantastical opponents: for instance, automata, undead, or otherworldly beings. After that point, the player starts doing really crazy stuff: going to planes of Oblivion, traveling outside of Skyrim, and truly saving the world.

## Spell Research
Librum is inherently a low-magic setting, so there is a lot working against you as a mage. However, if you _can_ discover the secrets of controlling magic, there is much more power available to you than in vanilla Skyrim. Many of the new spell "schools" or "archetypes" are described in the [Readme](README.md), so we focus here on how to start out.

First things first, you need to acquire your first spell. Most races do not start out with any spells (see the section on [character creation](#the-nightmare-of-lorkhan), so if you're not an Altmer, Dunmer, or Breton, you will need to acquire a spell elsewhere. Here are some important points on this front:
 - Spell tomes are exceedingly rare. Merchants do not sell them, they cannot be found in containers or on creatures, and only a few hand-placed ones exist in various dungeons.
 - You cannot read spell tomes above your skill level. For instance, if your Destruction skill is lower than 25, you cannot use an Apprentice tome.
 - The easiest way to acquire a spell is to enter the College of Winterhold. Faralda will still grant you one at the gate, and you now get to choose which school it's from. See [Better College Application](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5272) for more details.
 - You _can_ research your own spell without having one to begin with. Continue reading for more info on research.

![Alt Text](Resources/research.png?raw=true "Spell Research")

Prioritise getting a research journal, alembic and tongs.  
 - Go to college of Winterhold to get your first spell, unless you are a race that starts with one. Researching the spell will give you basic experience with some archetypes.  
 - If you find any strange items like "enchanted axe-head" analyze this to get LOTS of experience.   
 - Use the alembic to dissolve individual reagents you find, then analyze the resulting solution - this will grant experience and unlock new archetypes.  
 - Loot any rolls of paper, charcoal, inkwells or quills that you come across.   
 - In particular, find the solution that is used to make paper and ink! Select "mix solutions" and look what inputs are needed.  
 - Rest to get rid of mental exhaustion, note that longer rests have exponentially more effect - 8 hours+.   
 - Hold on to weakness/aversion poisons as these are used to fuel the cauldron. You can dissolve bulk quantities of reagents and get huge amounts of solutions.  
 - When analyzing solutions the xp gain is exponential - try to analyze them in batches of 100+.   
 - Prioritize getting reagents to make cauldron fuel  
 - Once you have unlock various archetypes you can compose theses.   
 - You can combine theses to try unlocking a spell, for novice rank only 20 xp in each archetype is enough. 1000 for apprentice!   
 - Duplicates can be used to boost the success chance - especially important when you are missing certain archetypes.  
 - When you have LOTS of experience you can throw in a single thesis and still get success.
