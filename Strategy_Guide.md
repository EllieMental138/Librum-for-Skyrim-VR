# Getting Started in Librum
This guide will help you get off the ground in Librum -- Librum changes a great deal about Skyrim's world, inhabitants, and mechanics, and you'll need to familiarize yourself with the new rules of the road. If you have not done so yet, read the [Readme](README.md) to install Librum and learn a little about it.

# Character Creation
## Appearance and Race
If you boot up Librum and create a new game, you'll find yourself in the new character creation area -- the [Realm of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18223) -- looking at the glitchy [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) menu. Before finalizing your race and appearance, here are the details you need to know:

***Race Abilites.*** Race abilities are given by EnaiSiaion's popular [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315) mod, with two modifications. Argonians are 50% resistant to _water damage_, and Orcs are 50% resistant to _earth damage_. These are new damage types introduced by [Elemental Destruction Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/440), and you will encounter enemy mages who make use of them. For detailed information on racial abilities, see the [Imperious mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315); notably, once-a-day powers have been replaced with interesting passive abilities, and you can unlock an additional ability by completing a race-specific objective.

There are a few non-ability-related differences between the various races. Importantly, _beast races cannot wear shoes_. In addition to locking them out of certain enchantments (e.g., muffle), this gives both Khajiits and Argonians a higher susceptibility to frostbite. You'll need to find alternate solutions, like magical spells or avoiding Skyrim's northern reaches, in order to avoid the cold.

Furthermore, some races start with spells. Although this doesn't make a huge difference in vanilla Skyrim, you'll find that beginning your Spell Research journey is otherwise very difficult. Namely:
 1. Altmer (High Elves) begin with _Fury_.
 2. Bretons begin with _Conjure Familiar_.
 3. Dunmer (Dark Elves) begin with _Sparks_. 

***Appearance.*** Next, you'll notice that the character appearance menu is a little janky. Unfortunately, that's the state of the art in Skyrim VR; to fine-tune settings, you need to make use of the new cursor. In particular, Librum comes with a few hundred graphical _overlays_ for your character: tattoos, scars, freckles, and more. These can be found in the _Makeup_ and _Paint_ tabs, at the far right of the menu. To apply a new overlay, click "Choose Texture" at the bottom of the menu, navigate to the one you want (using the cursor to scroll), and select it. Then, click "Choose Color" and repeat.

## The Realm of Lorkhan 
Once you finish selecting your race, gender, and appearance, you will be put into the [Realm of Lorkhan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18223) before venturing out into Skyrim. At this point, remember to set your MCM settings according to the [Readme](README.md#configure-the-mcm). 

![Alt Text](Resources/Realm.png?raw=true "The Realm of Lorkhan")

In the Realm, you can choose from plenty of equipment, spells, perks, factions, and starting locations. I will go over many of these in the section that follows. Importantly, note two major differences between Librum and the vanilla Realm of Lorkhan mod:
 - Once you leave the Realm, you cannot re-enter. For this reason, I recommend you make a save before exiting to Skyrim.
 - You can only choose a Standing Stone blessing from within the Realm of Lorkhan. Standing Stones still exist around Skyrim, but they are only aesthetic.

***Standing Stones.*** Every Standing Stone can be found within the Realm of Lorkhan, and -- as mentioned -- you can only choose a Standing Stone blessing while you are within the Realm. These blessings are governed by EnaiSiaion's [Andromeda](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14910) mod, and I recommend you look at that mod page for more information. Notably, once you find all thirteen Standing Stones around Skyrim, you unlock an additional, powerful ability, unique to the Stone you chose.

***Boons and Curses.*** There are unique Boons and Curses available within the Realm of Lorkhan, found around a reflecting pool to the left of the starting location. They are as follows:

_Boons_:
 - Boon of the Cat -- 1/2 fall damage.
 - Boon of the Locksmith -- lock "sweet spot" is 30% larger.
 - Boon of the Poisoner -- +10 strikes per poison applied.
 - Boon of the Pugilist -- +20 unarmed damage.
 - Boon of the Soul Reaver -- killed enemies restore 10% of their soul value to your enchanted weapon.
 - Voice of the Sky -- animals do not attack or flee from you, unless attacked.
 - Bardic Knowledge -- once per day, summon a spectral drum to give extra stamina regeneration.
_Curses_:
 - Curse of Antimagicka -- -100% magicka regeneration.
 - Curse of Generosity -- you sell items for half of their regular amount.
 - Curse of the Slow Learner -- -33% skill experience gain.
 - Curse of Soul Famine -- soul gems recharge 40% less energy.
 - Curse of the Unlucky -- enemies get a 10% chance to land critical hits on you.

***Classes.*** In the same location as the Boons and Curses, you can find several "Classes" available to you. These are not mutually exclusive, and they work the same way as Boons and Curses.

_Classes_:
 - Acrobat -- +5% movement speed, +20% melee damage reflection, +20% stamina regeneration.
 - Agent -- barter prices are 10% better, and bribes are 20% cheaper.
 - Arcane Smith -- tempering is 30% more effective, and enchantments are 20% stronger.
 - Archer -- +10% attack speed, and +20% slow effect while aiming.
 - Barbarian -- +30 armor, health regen in combat, and +20% health regen
 - Bard -- +10% critical chance, +10 Speech
 - Commoner -- start with 50 less health, magicka, and stamina
 - Healer -- +20 Restoration, +20 Alchemy
 - Knight -- +20% health regen, +20% magic resistance
 - Mage -- +100 magicka, +20% magicka regen

***Starting Locations.*** Once you've chosen your starting buffs and equipment, you have to choose where to start out in Skyrim. As mentioned before, you _cannot re-enter the Realm_ once you leave, so choose carefully.

Since the fast travel network is much denser in Librum's Skyrim -- with several new carriages and boats to bring you from place to place, thanks to [CFTO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) -- it largely does not matter if you start in one city or another. However, you'll want to be careful if you start in the wilderness or (even more dangerously) in a dungeon. Dungeons are now at fixed levels (labeled when you point your hand at the corresponding teleportation crystal), so make sure you choose a low-level one or feel particularly confident. Similarly, different wilderness zones offer different challenges, as catalogued in the [Creatures and Encounter Zones](#creatures-and-encounter-zones) section later on.

# Surviving the Night
## Making Money
Money is a rare commodity in Librum, and there are several new mechanics to familiarize yourself with before we start:
 - Money weighs you down. Each coin weighs 0.01 unit, so you won't be able to save up too much of it. This couples poorly with the new carry weight penalties catalogued in the next section.
 - You have to pay your followers to maintain their services. They need 500 Septims per week.
 - Barter prices depend greatly on you, your reputation, and the person you're trading with. Buying directly from producers and craftsmen will save you money, while trading with fences or general goods merchants will cost you. Merchants in bigger cities will have more gold to trade with. Prices will depend on your race, your faction memberships, and your relationship with the merchant.
 - Loot is generally much rarer. It won't be uncommon for you to unlock a chest and find nothing inside.
 - Many more things are considered crimes, and you'll be fined appropriately. This includes waiting in cities ("vagrancy"), using crafting apparatuses without permission, using loud crafting apparatuses at night ("disturbing the peace"), hunting without a license, looting friendly corpses, and sitting in the Jarl's throne. If you want to make money, be sure to follow the rules.

With that out of the way, there are a few good strategies to get money early on. 
 - You can sell firewood at lumbermills to get some easy cash, and also in some inns.

### Carry Weight Penalties

# New Gameplay Mechanics
## Spell Research
Librum is inherently a low-magic setting, so there is a lot working against you as a mage. However, if you _can_ discover the secrets of controlling magic, there is much more power available to you than in vanilla Skyrim. Many of the new spell "schools" or "archetypes" are described in the [Readme](README.md), so we focus here on how to start out.

First things first, you need to acquire your first spell. Most races do not start out with any spells (see the section on [character creation](#the-realm-of-lorkhan)), so if you're not an Altmer, Dunmer, or Breton, you will need to acquire a spell elsewhere. Here are some important points on this front:
 - Spell tomes are exceedingly rare. Merchants do not sell them, they cannot be found in containers or on creatures, and only a few hand-placed ones exist in various dungeons.
 - You cannot read spell tomes above your skill level. For instance, if your Destruction skill is lower than 25, you cannot use an Apprentice tome.
 - The easiest way to acquire a spell is to enter the College of Winterhold. Faralda will still grant you one at the gate, and you now get to choose which school it's from. See [Better College Application](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5272) for more details.
 - You _can_ research your own spell without having one to begin with. Continue reading for more info on research.

***Below this is WIP.***

 - Prioritise getting a research journal, alembic and tongs.  
 - Go to college of Winterhold to get your first spell, unless you are a race that starts with one. Researching the spell will give you basic experience with some archetypes.  
 - If you find any strange items like "enchanted axe-head" analyze this to get LOTS of experience.   
 - Use the alembic to dissolve individual reagents you find, then analyze the resulting solution - this will grant experience and unlock new archetypes.  
 - Loot any rolls of paper, charcoal, inkwells or quills that you come across.   
 - In particular, find the solution that is used to make paper and ink! Select "mix solutions" and look what inputs are needed.  
 - Rest to get rid of mental exhaustion, note that longer rests have exponentially more effect - 8 hours+.   
 - Hold on to weakness/aversion poisons as these are used to fuel the cauldron. You can dissolve bulk quantities of reagents and get huge amounts of solutions.  
 - When analyzing solutions the xp gain is exponential - try to analyze them in batches of 100+.   
 - Prioritize getting reagents to make cauldron fuel  
 - Once you have unlock various archetypes you can compose theses.   
 - You can combine theses to try unlocking a spell, for novice rank only 20 xp in each archetype is enough. 1000 for apprentice!   
 - Duplicates can be used to boost the success chance - especially important when you are missing certain archetypes.  
 - When you have LOTS of experience you can throw in a single thesis and still get success.
